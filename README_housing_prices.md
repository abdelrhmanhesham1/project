**🏠 Housing Price Prediction**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models. 

By analyzing various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and additional amenities, the model estimates house prices with high accuracy.

The project also includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure a robust predictive model.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Pandas & NumPy – Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models (Linear & Polynomial Regression)

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization and correlation heatmaps

Plotly – Interactive visualizations for model performance analysis

**⚙️ Features**

✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical features.

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Correlation heatmaps, boxplots, and summary statistics.

✔ Feature Engineering & Selection – Selecting the most relevant features based on correlation analysis.

✔ Model Training & Evaluation – Implementing:

Linear Regression (Custom & Scikit-learn)

Polynomial Regression (Degree = 2) for better accuracy

✔ Performance Metrics – Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.

✔ Visualization of Predictions – Comparing models with scatter plots and regression curves.

📂 **Dataset**

The dataset contains housing attributes such as:

Price

Area

Number of bedrooms & bathrooms

Stories, parking, and other amenities

The target variable (price) represents the selling price of the house.

📊 **Model Performance**

Model	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Linear Regression (Scratch)	0.826

Linear Regression (Scikit-learn)	0.826

Polynomial Regression (Degree = 2)	0.793

**🔹 Polynomial Regression provides better accuracy due to its ability to capture complex relationships in data.**
